# Yolov8 pre-trained model for pothole detection

1. The detect.py file is a code for open the trained YOLOv8 model using opencv. 
2. We also set the region of interest (ROI) at specfic location from the video.  
3. We also extract the bounding box coordinates from the detected object and save into CSV file.
